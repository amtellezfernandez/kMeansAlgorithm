# K-Means Clustering and Gradient Descent Variants in Spark

I offer the two versions of the code, in HTML and in Scala.
This repository is the final project of the course Machine Learnign for Big Data from the Master 2 Artificial Intelligence and Data Science (IASD). This project explores the implementation and optimization of K-Means clustering algorithms using Apache Spark in Scala, and investigates different variants of the Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) algorithm. The focus is on optimizing performance for large-scale data processing in distributed environments.


BigData Final Project: K-Means Clustering and Gradient Descent Variants in Spark
Welcome to the repository for the BigData Final Project! This project explores the implementation and optimization of K-Means clustering algorithms using Apache Spark in Scala, and investigates different variants of the Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) algorithm. The focus is on optimizing performance for large-scale data processing in distributed environments.
